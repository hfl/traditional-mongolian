### The max number of input keys for every phrase or character.
MAX_KEY_LENGTH = 2

### Use auto_commit mode as default

DEF_FULL_WIDTH_PUNCT = FALSE
### Not use full width letter by default
DEF_FULL_WIDTH_LETTER = FALSE

### Whether user are allow to define phrase, default is true
### You have to define the word construction rules below.
### For input methods which do not input phrases, set this to False

### Rules for constructing user defined phrase
### "ce" stands for "ci equal", a Chinese English :), means "phrase length
### equal to", thus ce2 -> phrase length equal to 2; and "ca" means "phrase
### length equal or above", so ca4 -> phrase length equal or above 4.
### p21 -> the 1st key of 2nd character in the phrase, and so on.
### Each rule separate via ";". 
### Example below is a complete rule-set, 
### becuase [2,2] ∩ [3,3] ∩ [4,+∞] = [2,+∞], which is the range of length
### of phrase. This have to be satisfied if you need ibus-table to build up
### your own inputed phrase via your daily using.
### RULES = ce2:p11+p12+p21+p22;ce3:p11+p21+p22+p31;ca4:p11+p21+p31+p41

### Since some input methods use different table for every character to make
### phrase, such as ZhengMa, they need explict define the goucima (the
### phrase-building code for the given character), the format of every entry is
### "character\tgoucima\n". 
### For the input method which just use the full code as word-building code
### just skip this field. The ibus-table will build the codes needed from
### above TABLE.
### if you don't need different word-building code, please comment out the
### next few lines with ###, just like these lines you are look at now.
### BEGIN_GOUCI
